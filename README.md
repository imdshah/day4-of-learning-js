# Day 4 of learning JavaScript
- Today I learned about type conversion and type coercion.
- Learned about "==" (loose equal) vs "===" (strict equal) operators.
- Learned about other comparison operators.
----------------------------------------------------
## Implicit conversion = type coercion
- Type coercion is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another by JavaScript without any user intervention.
- Type coercion happens in ==, !=, >, <, >=, <= operators but not in === and !== operators.

## Type conversion
- Type conversion is the explicit conversion of values from one data type to another using functions like String(), Number(), Boolean(), etc.
